MBBEFD provides additional distributions to R, such as the MBBEFD and
shifted truncated Pareto as well as functions to handle destruction rate
models.

The distributions and models of the mbbefd package are particular
popular for understanding and pricing risk in general insurance and
reinsurance and are used for exposure rating, benchmarking and curve
fitting.
